> TL;DR- The DTC has been taken over by big money. They transitioned from a manual to a computerized ledger system in the 80s, and it played a significant role in the 1987 market crash. In 2003, several issuers with the DTC wanted to remove their securities from the DTC's deposit account because the DTC's participants were naked short selling their securities. Turns out, they were right. The DTC and it's participants have created a market-sized naked short selling scheme. All of this is made possible by the DTC's enrollee- Cede & Co.

## notes:
- DTCC Rule SR-DTC-2003-02 ([[market.org.dtcc.rules.sr-dtc-2003-02]])
    > The DTC passed that rule change....

    > They not only prevented the issuers from removing their deposits, they also turned a 'blind-eye' to their participants manipulative short selling, even when there's public evidence of them doing so...

    > ....Those companies were being attacked with shares THEY put in the DTC, by institutions they can't even identify...
