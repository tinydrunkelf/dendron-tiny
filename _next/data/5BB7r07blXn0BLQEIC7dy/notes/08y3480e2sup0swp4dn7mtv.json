Citadel owns a company called Palafox Trading and uses them to EXCLUSIVELY short &#x26; trade treasury securities. Palafox manages one fund for Citadel - the Citadel Global Fixed Income Master Fund LTD. Total assets over $123 BILLION and 80% are owned by offshore investors in the Cayman Islands. Their reverse repo agreements are ENTIRELY rehypothecated and they CANNOT pay off their own repo agreements until someone pays them, first. The ENTIRE global financial economy is modeled after a fractional reserve system that is beginning to experience THE MOTHER OF ALL MARGIN CALLS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>THIS is why the DTC and FICC are requiring an increase in SLR deposits.
