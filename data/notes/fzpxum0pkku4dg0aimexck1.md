> TL:DR - Here's the proof... we were lied to.... the numbers don't add up.. shorts did not cover during January and I still don't see how they could have. Read this FULLY and tell me I'm wrong

## notes:
- short interest, according to [[market.people.ihor_dusaniwsky]] as of january 28, 2021: __58.3%__, recalculated by u/atobitt
    >  If you keep the same figures I reported above (70m / 50m) and recalculate SI% the way that Ihor suggests, here's the result: 70m shorts / (50m float + 70m SYNTHETIC shares) = 70m shorts / 120m TOTAL SHARES = 58.3%
- [[market.definitions.synthetic_long]]
    > Whenever you short sell a stock, the obligation to repurchase that share at a later date is created. Therefore, what Ihor is saying is that each obligation to purchase a FUTURE share should be treated as an ADDITIONAL share to those that already exist.
- fail to mark short sales, [[reddit.user.atobitt.house_of_cards]] 
    > If you haven't read the HOC series and don't know about the ways that companies fail to mark the short sale indicator on their shares, then I would suggest you go back and do that. It's the most obvious way for a company to conceal short positions.
- SEC's report
    > Short interest can exceed 100% - as it did with GME - when the same shares are lent multiple times by successive purchasers.
