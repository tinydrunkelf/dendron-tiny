<p>TL:DR - Here's the proof... we were lied to.... the numbers don't add up.. shorts did not cover during January and I still don't see how they could have. Read this FULLY and tell me I'm wrong</p>

<li>short interest, according to <a href="/dendron-tiny/notes/c9m1uid9tcpmfkql9rj01yt">Ihor Dusaniwsky</a> as of january 28, 2021: <strong>58.3%</strong>, recalculated by u/atobitt
<blockquote>
<p> If you keep the same figures I reported above (70m / 50m) and recalculate SI% the way that Ihor suggests, here's the result: 70m shorts / (50m float + 70m SYNTHETIC shares) = 70m shorts / 120m TOTAL SHARES = 58.3%</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you short sell a stock, the obligation to repurchase that share at a later date is created. Therefore, what Ihor is saying is that each obligation to purchase a FUTURE share should be treated as an ADDITIONAL share to those that already exist.</p>

<li>fail to mark short sales, <a href="/dendron-tiny/notes/9qrbaqc61q0lngpoenupqee">A House of Cards (part 1) -- u/atobitt</a> 
<blockquote>
<p>If you haven't read the HOC series and don't know about the ways that companies fail to mark the short sale indicator on their shares, then I would suggest you go back and do that. It's the most obvious way for a company to conceal short positions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Short interest can exceed 100% - as it did with GME - when the same shares are lent multiple times by successive purchasers.</p>
